# Coding Assessment Quiz

## Description
In this project I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a 5 question multiple choice coding assessment quiz. Each questions has 4 choices. The user is first shown an intro page, where they have the option to start the quiz or view the high scores. 

The user has 75 seconds to answer all questions. Each correct answer gains the user 1 point, and each incorrect answer subtracts 5 seconds from the clock. When a user selects an answer, they will see feedback below the question box letting them know if they got the question correct or incorrect. The quiz is over once one of the following conditions is met: all questions have been answered, or the timer reaches 0. 

Once the user has completed the quiz, they are presented with their final score. They have the choice to save their score into local storage by typing in their two character initials and clicking the "Save Score" button.
